[OverTheWire: Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/)

# Level 0

> Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

> Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where X is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.

> Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up. All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/. E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natas5 and only readable by natas4 and natas5.

> Start here:

> Username: natas0
Password: natas0
URL:      http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org

Sure enough...

Honestly I don't know what they're getting at with the 'no right click' business. The password is in the source again, maybe it's a challenge for people who don't use ctrl+u.

There's an image tag in the source but no aparent image, let's investigate that.

```
<img src="files/pixel.png">
```

![natas02-02](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas02-02.png)

In fact it is a pixel! Looking into the directory...

![natas02-03](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas02-03.png)

The file users.txt contains what we're after.

```
# username:password
alice:BYNdCesZqW
bob:jw2ueICLvT
charlie:G5vCxkVV3m
natas3:sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14

mallory:9urtcpzBmH
```

# Level 3 > Level 4

![natas03-01](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas03-01.png)

We're a bit more in the dark this time, there in fact is nothing on the page.

```html
<body>
<h1>natas3</h1>
<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->
</div>
</body>
```

The comment about Google not finding the page is a hint to look for robots.txt, a file that is used to instruct search engines to not index certain resources. I'll use `curl` to pull that down as an excuse to show how to use that with authentication.

```
otw@sake:~/natas$ curl -u natas3:sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14 http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/
```

A s3cr3t directory, of course.

![natas03-02](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas03-02.png)

As before, users.txt contains the password.

```

I wondered how long this challenge could go on without my wanting to use Burp Suite. The text on the page suggests that we should 'come from' a particular domain so we'll set that as the referer header. This is easily accomplished by intercepting and modifying the request in Burp's proxy.

![natas04-02](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas04-02.png)

Success!

A cookie was set along with this response. 

```
Set-Cookie: loggedin=0
```

Pretty clear what to do. For simple tasks involving viewing or modifying cookies directly in the browser, I like the Cookies Manager+ plugin for Firefox.

![natas05-02](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas05-02.png)

Refresh the page to send our new cookie - success.

# Level 6 > Level 7

![natas06-01](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas06-01.png)

Clicking the link...

```html
 <html>
[...]
<body>
<h1>natas6</h1>
<div id="content">

<?

include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>

<form method=post>
Input secret: <input name=secret><br>
<input type=submit name=submit>
</form>

<div id="viewsource"><a href="index-source.html">View sourcecode</a></div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

The input in the form POST's to 'secret' and we need to match that to what's stored in $secret. This isn't set but it could be in the included file. Looking at /includes/secret.inc...

```
<?
$secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
?>
```

Copying this into the form and submitting - success.

# Level 7 > Level 8

![natas07-01](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas07-01.png)

Each link has a similar form, where page is a parameter sent to index.php.

```
http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home
```

As a guess since we've seen a lot of 'secret' things...

![natas07-02](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas07-02.png)

Ah ha, file inclusion. Furthermore, a hint in the page's source reminds us where we can find natas8's password.

```html
<!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->
```

Visit `http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8`.

![natas07-03](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas07-03.png)

# Level 8 > Level 9

![natas08-01](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas08-01.png)

Source code...

```html
 <html>
[...]
<body>
<h1>natas8</h1>
<div id="content">

<?

$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
    } else {
    print "Wrong secret";
    }
}
?>

<form method=post>
Input secret: <input name=secret><br>
<input type=submit name=submit>
</form>

<div id="viewsource"><a href="index-source.html">View sourcecode</a></div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

We need to find an input that, when put through the `encodeSecret()` function, results in the value stored in $encodedSecret. Reversing each action performed by `encodeSecret()` on $encodedSecret should get us what we need.

The steps: convert hex values to ASCII, reverse string, base64 decode. This can be done by piping some commands together on the command line.

```
otw@sake:~/natas$ echo 3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362 | xxd -p -r | rev | base64 -d
oubWYf2kBqotw
```

An explanation... `xxd -r` reverses a hexdump, adding `-p` makes it accept just a string of hex rather than a formatted hexdump (with line numbers, etc).

```
otw@sake:~/natas$ echo 3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362 | xxd -p -r
==QcCtmMml1ViV3b
```

Then, `rev` will reverse the line.

```
otw@sake:~/natas$ echo 3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362 xxd -p -r | rev
b3ViV1lmMmtCcQ==
```

Lastly, base64 decode and we have our input value for the form.

```
otw@sake:~/natas$ echo 3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362 | xxd -p -r | rev | base64 -d
oubWYf2kBq
```

# Level 9 > Level 10

![natas09-01](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas09-01.png)

Source...

```html
 <html>
[...]
<body>
<h1>natas9</h1>
<div id="content">
<form>
Find words containing: <input name=needle><input type=submit name=submit value=Search><br><br>
</form>


Output:
<pre>
<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
}
?>
</pre>

<div id="viewsource"><a href="index-source.html">View sourcecode</a></div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

User input is being passed directly into a command fed to the system. If I have a single favorite type of attack, it's probably command injection. A quick test to confirm we can break their command with a semicolon and execute ours.

![natas09-02](/assets/images/otw-natas/natas09-02.png)

Yep. `cat` out the password in /etc/natas_webpass/natas10, profit.
