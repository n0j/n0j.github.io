# Level 24 > Level 25

```
 <html>
<head>[...]
<script>var wechallinfo = { "level": "natas24", "pass": "<censored>" };</script></head>
<body>
<h1>natas24</h1>
<div id="content">

Password:
<form name="input" method="get">
    <input type="text" name="passwd" size=20>
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>

<?php
    if(array_key_exists("passwd",$_REQUEST)){
        if(!strcmp($_REQUEST["passwd"],"<censored>")){
            echo "<br>The credentials for the next level are:<br>";
            echo "<pre>Username: natas25 Password: <censored></pre>";
        }
        else{
            echo "<br>Wrong!<br>";
        }
    }
    // morla / 10111
?>
<div id="viewsource"><a href="index-source.html">View sourcecode</a></div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

This one was baffling at first. The only way `!strcmp($_REQUEST["passwd"],"<censored>"` is going to be true to proceed into the conditional is if `strcmp` returns 0, which only occurs when the strings [are equal](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strcmp.php) including case. Sooo we have to completely guess the password and that's it?

I happened to notice in the HTML head, which I normally remove, that the password to the current level for `wechallinfo` is censored. Normally the current passsword is shown there because we already know it. 

```
<script>var wechallinfo = { "level": "natas24", "pass": "<censored>" };</script>
```

Is the current password what we're looking for?
