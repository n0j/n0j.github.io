Oh crap!

My first thought was to donwload the page because it would be funny to put this up on something of my own one day. So, to the source...

The FBI logo image having the filename 'fbi-logo' seemed odd to me, not sure why. And what's that hash in meta?

```
<meta name="description" content="304183039b6f7a2595db858f05eab355" />
```

Google'd it out of curiosity. Ah. The answer hadn't occured to me because April isn't until tomorow.
